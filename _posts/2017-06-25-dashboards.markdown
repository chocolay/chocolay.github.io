Data dashboards are convenient, powerful ways to explore real-time business data. I've made them for a gold mining company in Australia, a department store chain, several banks, and a hospital system.

Unfortunately, dashboards are difficult to share for the same reasons they are so fun to make and use. They typically are developed with live, proprietary data from the client's servers which allows us to quickly see insights, filter data, or make on-the-fly calculations.
