This tool was built for a client who wanted to illustrate the interconnectivity of their data.

To use it:
- Click in the open area to create a circle that represents a cluster of data. The default is that the colors are determined by the position where you clicked.  To start with, it is assumed that all members within a single group are 100% alike (with actual data, this might be a correlation)

- Double-clicking on a group allows you to edit its name, color, and the "similarity" number 

- The closer together the circles, the more similar the groups are. Groups closer than a threshold (which you can adjust) are connected by a line.
             
- Repositioning a circle changes the correlation between its group and its neighbors. You can edit this number in the table, in which case it becomes fixed.

While this tool only presents data in a 2-dimensional space &mdash; and data relationships are typically much more complicated &mdash; the client requested this tool so they could rapdily assemble networks manually for illustrative purposes. The full tool has been used in presentations to investors to illustrate goals in an AI-based business.
