A client's subscription-based business grew up from a shoestring operation to a complex set of services, discounts, and enticements for renewals.
His whole business operation was dependant on an enormous spreadsheet filled with individual customers and their interactions.
It was difficult to use and, he felt, impossible for him to delegate because couldn't easily explain how he saw the business worked.
                
I built an agent-based forecasting model to test assumptions in his business and to gauge what impact they made to his bottom line.

After talking to him about how he saw his business, the visualization of customers zipping from one category to another was also built.
He now has a tool for employees and investors to explore and to ultimately understand the mechanism of his business.
