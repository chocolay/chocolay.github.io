I've developed a variety of animated, interactive, and accurate tools for use in STEM education and research. Through Carnegie Institute funding, I developed a statistics package for use in undergraduate courses. I've also developed tools for solving partial differential equations, and for use in physics and geoscience classrooms.

I've also supported start up companies developing: earthquake prediction tools through "shake data" collected by cell phones throughout a region and a company developing long-term weather forecasts used in the oil futures market.
