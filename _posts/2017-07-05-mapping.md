Interactive, custom maps are a fun and useful tool and I've wound up making a bunch of them --- from explaining birch bark scrolls created in the 1840sto the <span class = bold>widely used 270 to Win app</span><span class='tooltip'>*<span class="tooltiptext">
                as seen in the Washington Post and 538.com.</span></span>
                
Typically, maps and other interactive visualizations are built into a client's larger website. Oftentimes, I'll write my code to only require a single <span class="coding">div</span> element so that it easily and quickly fits into the overall design. 
                    
[This particular map](http://www.eliseralph.com/WorldMap/) was built to display the multi-year global "Policy Coherence Index for Development." The illustrated policy can be changed by the colored index in the upper right corner and the year is controlled by the slider on the bottom.
