This client wanted to link multiple datasets. When an event in a dataset contains dozens of fields, it can be difficult to convey all the connections one wants &emdash; particularly if the database queries and coding are far from the actual decision makers.
<br><br> 
This tool created a visual way to link fields in two datasets so that the managers could make their intent clear.
