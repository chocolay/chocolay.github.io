Baseball enthusiasts are notoriously interested in tracking stats of their favorite players. The owner of 
an online fantasy baseball site contacted me to do some visualizations for his users. The 
one that proved most popular was a visualization of where a player hits the ball over the course of a game, a 
season, or a career. This one was for Ted Williams.

Hits were recorded as landing in one of 38 zones with confusing names like "oflcf", "ofrfc", "ofrfl", etc. and that made it challenging for users to 
see patterns among players.

The challenge for me had to do with figuring out where to put the balls on the screen, given the zone information. Because a baseball field isn't shaped like a wedge of pie but more like an ice cream cone, the zones don't have consistent shapes and so a 
new coordinate system had to be developed.
