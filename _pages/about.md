- Since leaving my academic life behind, I have created data models and visualizations for bankers, mining companies, geoscientists, life hackers, sound engineers, geneticists, election followers, department stores, historians, financial managers, network engineers, musicians, policy makers, STEM educators, students, and baseball enthusiasts.

 - Prior life: tenured, award-winning physics professor, program director at the National Science Foundation, senior research administrator on 2 college campuses. 
 
 -Academic research: modeling of nonlinear partial differential equations, analysis of oceanic surface currents, observations and modeling of Lake Superior & Issyk Kul. 
 
 - I've spent months at sea collecting data and countless hours tinkering with instrumentation and numerical models in the lab. 

- tropical Pacific island-hopper, I've lived on Guam (Hafa Adai!) and travelled to Palau, Rota, Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Majuro, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Britain, New Ireland, Tahiti, Moorea, Easter Island, Oahu, and Hawaii.

- once a member of the Upper Peninsula diaspora, I have returned and now live just down the beach from where I grew up. 

- gardener, coffee drinker, collaborator with entrepreneurs, hobbyists & established companies around the world

- builder of complex deep learning models, physics-based simulations, and data visualizations over the web.

I especially enjoy building customized interactive tools that elegantly solve a client's particular issue with data -- whether management, analysis, or modeling.
