And I'm far more approachable & good-natured than my avatar appears.

I'm a former academic who fell in love with deep learning and data visualization. Since leaving my academic life behind, I have created data models and visualizations for bankers, mining companies, geoscientists, life hackers, sound engineers, geneticists, election followers, department stores, historians, financial managers, network engineers, musicians, policy makers, STEM educators, students, and baseball enthusiasts.

My first degree is in physics and I was a tenured, award-winning physics professor before working as a program director at the National Science Foundation. My academic research involved modeling of nonlinear partial differential equations, statistics of oceanic surface currents to improve satellite-based measurements, and observations on Lake Superior and Issyk Kul, in Kyrgyzstan. I've spent months at sea collecting data and countless hours tinkering with instrumentation and numerical models in the lab. I also served as a senior university administrator in charge of research and graduate education at two different university campuses.

After I left academia, I island-hopped around the tropical Pacific for months before settling down in the Upper Peninsula, just down the beach from where I grew up. Nowadays I garden, drink coffee with my parents, and work with entrepreneurs, hobbyists & established companies around the world, building complex deep learning models, physics-based simulations, and data visualizations over the web.

I'm always happy to chat about possible projects, so please <a href="mailto:elise.ralph@gmail.com?subject=tell%20me%20more!"> <span class = redTreeChar>send me a message</span></a> if you'd like to chat sometime.
