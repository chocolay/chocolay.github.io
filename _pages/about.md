-   [![Elise](/images/13028173.jpg)](){: .image-left } I have created data models and visualizations for bankers, mining companies, geoscientists, life hackers, sound engineers, geneticists, election followers, department stores, historians, financial managers, network engineers, musicians, policy makers, STEM educators, students, and baseball enthusiasts.


I especially enjoy building customized interactive tools that elegantly solve a client's particular issue with data -- whether management, analysis, or modeling.

I'm always happy to chat about possible projects, so feel free to <a href="mailto:elise.ralph@gmail.com?subject=I%20saw%20your%20webpage%20and%20..."> <span class = redTreeChar>send me a message</span></a>.
