Hi, my name is Elise 

I'm a former academic who fell in love with deep learning and data visualization. Since leaving my academic life behind, I have created data models and visualizations for bankers, mining companies, geoscientists, life hackers, sound engineers, geneticists, department stores, historians, real estate managers, musicians, policy makers, STEM education, and baseball enthusiasts.

My first degree is in physics and I was a tenured, award-winning physics professor before working as a program director at the National Science foundation. My academic research involved modeling of nonlinear partial differential equations, statistics of oceanic surface currents to improve satellite-based measurements, observations on Lake Superior and Issyk Kul. I have also served as a senior university administrator in charge of research and graduate education. Now I work with entrepreneurs and established companies to build complex web-based deep learning models and data visualizations.
